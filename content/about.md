Hi, I'm Eric! I'm a data scientist and education researcher. I am currently a data scientist for Chesterfield County Public Schools, where I use data to help guide decisions and improve both students' and teachers' educational experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, coding, working out, baking, and spending time with friends & family (including my pup, Nala).

I earned my PhD in educational psychology from VCU in 2019. In my [dissertation](https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/), I studied how writers' emotional states influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.

## Writing

I (irregularly) write a newsletter called [Edudata](https://www.edudata.blog/) mostly about stuff residing at the intersection of education and data.

I take notes about coding, stats, fitness, and anything else interesting to me at [Brain](https://ekholme.github.io/brain/), my public notes site.
