# My AI Policy

I don't use AI to write anything you read here, or on any of my other sites. I enjoy writing, plus it helps me think, and I don't want to farm my writing or thinking out to our AI overlords.

That said, I do use AI for some things, including fact-checking understanding of certain topics (this is mostly relevant for my notes site) or for helping with technical non-writing things around the site.

[h/t Vicki](https://vickiboykis.com/ai/) for the inspiration for this page.
