      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Eric! I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist and education researcher. I am currently a data scientist for Chesterfield County Public Schools, where I use data to help guide decisions and improve both students&amp;rsquo; and teachers&amp;rsquo; educational experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, coding, working out, baking, and spending time with friends &amp;amp; family (including my pup, Nala).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I earned my PhD in educational psychology from VCU in 2019. In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/etd/5977/&#34;&gt;dissertation&lt;/a&gt;, I studied how writers&amp;rsquo; emotional states influenced their productivity as well as the day-to-day inertia of these emotional states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the past several years, I&amp;rsquo;ve built my personal website using &lt;a href=&#34;https://quarto.org/&#34;&gt;Quarto&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, I was using Rmarkdown. So the transition to Quarto wasn&amp;rsquo;t really even a switch in philosophy; rather, it was more like upgrading to a different piece of software that did basically the same thing&amp;hellip;only better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, though, I decided I wanted to simplify my website, and part of this simplification entails switching from Quarto to &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to build my site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
