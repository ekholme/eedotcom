          <p>For the past several years, I&rsquo;ve built my personal website using <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>. Before that, I was using Rmarkdown. So the transition to Quarto wasn&rsquo;t really even a switch in philosophy; rather, it was more like upgrading to a different piece of software that did basically the same thing&hellip;only better.</p>
<p>Recently, though, I decided I wanted to simplify my website, and part of this simplification entails switching from Quarto to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> to build my site.</p>
<p>The motivating factor for me here is that I simply don&rsquo;t need all of the features that Quarto offers to create the site that I want now. When I first created my personal website, maybe 7 years ago, I was doing a lot of blogging that involved data analysis. I would find a dataset &ndash; often one part of the <a href="https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday">TidyTuesday</a> project &ndash; and work my way through a handful of analyses. My intentions here were twofold. First, I used these blog posts as a way to improve my coding in R. I might use a given dataset to learn more about ggplot themes, or I might use one to gain practice fitting multilevel models, or to practice with the <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org/">{purrr} package</a>.</p>
<p>Second, I used these posts as a way both to network and build a portfolio. Before Elon&rsquo;s takeover of Twitter, the <code>#rstats</code> community over there was vibrant, and participating in <code>#TidyTuesday</code> &ndash; or else just posting any of your R content &ndash; was a great way to meet similarly-minded people.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2026, though, and I&rsquo;m less interested in writing regular data-analysis blog posts anymore, whether using R or Python or Julia or any other language. I&rsquo;m still constantly trying to improve my proficiency in all of those languages, but I&rsquo;ve been doing so through other means (such as maintaining <a href="https://ekholme.github.io/brain/">Brain, my personal notes site</a>, or regularly working on coding &ldquo;katas&rdquo;).</p>
<p>And so I don&rsquo;t really need all of the capabilities Quarto offers for my personal site anymore. This isn&rsquo;t meant as a knock against Quarto &ndash; I still use it regularly to create reports at work. But I&rsquo;ve used Hugo to create other sites before, and given my current needs, it just feels like a better fit. It&rsquo;s simpler and faster, which is what I want right now. And if I ever feel compelled to write a &ldquo;data-analysis&rdquo; flavored blog post, it&rsquo;s only moderately more work to do so.</p>
